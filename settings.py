    This module is written in Python 3

    This module reads and interprets the Reynir.conf configuration file.
    The file can include other files using the $include directive,
    making it easier to arrange configuration sections into logical
    and manageable pieces.

    Sections are identified like so: [ section_name ]

    Comments start with # signs.

    Sections are interpreted by section handlers.
