    TnT - Statistical POS tagger
    (Description from original NLTK source)
    TnT uses a second order Markov model to produce tags for
    a sequence of input, specifically:
      argmax [Proj(P(t_i|t_i-1,t_i-2)P(w_i|t_i))] P(t_T+1 | t_T)
    IE: the maximum projection of a set of probabilities
    The set of possible tags for a given word is derived
    from the training data. It is the set of all tags
    that exact word has been assigned.
    To speed up and get more precision, we can use log addition
    to instead multiplication, specifically:
      argmax [Sigma(log(P(t_i|t_i-1,t_i-2))+log(P(w_i|t_i)))] +
             log(P(t_T+1|t_T))
    The probability of a tag for a given word is the linear
    interpolation of 3 markov models; a zero-order, first-order,
    and a second order model.
      P(t_i| t_i-1, t_i-2) = l1*P(t_i) + l2*P(t_i| t_i-1) +
                             l3*P(t_i| t_i-1, t_i-2)
    A beam search is used to limit the memory usage of the algorithm.
    The degree of the beam can be changed using N in the initialization.
    N represents the maximum number of possible solutions to maintain
    while tagging.
    It is possible to differentiate the tags which are assigned to
    capitalized words. However this does not result in a significant
    gain in the accuracy of the results.
