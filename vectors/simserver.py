    This module implements a similarity query server. The server can
    answer queries about articles that are similar to a given article
    or topic vector. This assumes that articles already have topic vectors
    that are stored in the topic_vector column in the articles database table.

    The similarity server by default accepts TCP connections on port 5001.
    For security, this port should be closed from outside access via iptables or
    a firewall. However, the server also requires the client to authenticate
    using a secret key that is loaded from resources/SimilarityServerKey.txt.
    This file should not be made visible outside the Greynir server (or local
    network).

    To register this program as a service within systemd, create a unit file
    called similarity.service in the /etc/systemd/system directory, containing
    somthing like the following (assuming you have a virtualenv called venv):

        [Unit]
        Description=Greynir document similarity service
        After=postgresql.service
        Before=greynir.service

        [Service]
        Type=simple
        User=[YOUR USERNAME]
        Group=[YOUR GROUPNAME]
        WorkingDirectory=/home/[YOUR USERNAME]/Greynir/vectors
        ExecStart=/home/[YOUR USERNAME]/Greynir/vectors/venv/bin/python simserver.py
        Environment="PATH=/home/[YOUR USERNAME]/Greynir/vectors/venv/bin"
        Environment="PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8"
        Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=True"
        StandardOutput=syslog
        StandardError=syslog

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target

    Then run:
        $ sudo systemctl enable similarity
        $ sudo systemctl start similarity
